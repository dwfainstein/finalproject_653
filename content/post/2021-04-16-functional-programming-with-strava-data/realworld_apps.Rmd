```{r setup, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
#note: include = FALSE and echo = FALSE for now, but it will still print messages and can be coerced to show full chunks of code if we desire

library(tidyverse)
library(purrr)
library(repurrrsive)
library(here)
library(janitor)
library(lubridate)

```

This will produce an overlay of the Strava data (specifically bike rides) on top of Eugene, Oregon bike paths. City planners use Strava data to understand high-use areas within the city to help avoid accidents involving bikers and runners. 


```{r firststep}
#reading in data
strav_data <- read_csv(here("content/post/2021-04-16-functional-programming-with-strava-data/data", "strav_csv.csv"))

#starting with some initial tidying
dataready <- strav_data %>% 
  select(where(~length(unique(.)) > 1)) %>%
  clean_names() %>% 
  mutate_if(is.numeric, ~round(., 2))


#load in googlemaps polylines
polylate <- function(activity_id){
  this_activity <- get_activity(id = activity_id, stoken = stoken)
  this_polyline <- this_activity$map$summary_polyline
  decoded_polyline <- gepaf::decodePolyline(this_polyline)
  return(decoded_polyline)
}

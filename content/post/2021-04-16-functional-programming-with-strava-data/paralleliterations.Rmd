Strava is an excellent way to keep track of physical activity on an individual basis. 

We will begin by reading in a batch of data from one individual.

```{r firststep}
#reading in data for sandbox
strav_data <- read_csv(here("content/post/2021-04-16-functional-programming-with-strava-data/data", "strav_csv.csv"))

#initial function for tidying Stravadata
tidydata <- strav_data %>% 
  select(where(~length(unique(.)) > 1)) %>%
    # selecting unique values
  clean_names() %>% 
  mutate_if(is.numeric, ~round(., 2)) %>% 
    # rounding values to remove clutter for visualization
  mutate(type = as.factor(type)) %>%  
  dplyr::rename(act_type = type) %>% 
  separate(start_date_local, c("date","time"), sep = " ") %>% 
  select(-start_date) %>% 
    #separating out date & time; excluding multiple dates and times
  filter(elapsed_time > 0,
         max_speed > average_speed)


```

Then we will create a function that allows us to turn dates into days of the week and times into periods during the day. This will help us to categorize activities by days of the week and time periods within the day.

```{r secondstep}

#creating data
weeklydata <- tidydata %>%
  select(date, time, act_type)

#function to modify date format to day of the week
daysoftheweek <- function(d, date) {
  days_of_week <- c("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday")
  date <- seq(Sys.Date() - 5, Sys.Date(), by = 1)
  index <- as.POSIXlt(date)$way
  print(weekday)
}

#grouping data by activity
byact <- weeklydata %>%
  group_by(act_type) %>%
  nest()


```

This is an iteration of weekly activity Monday - Sunday categorized by time of day. 

```{r thirdstep}

````

This is another iteration of weekly activity Monday - Sunday categorized by time of day.

```{r fourthstep}

#saving plots
#create a directory
fs::dir_create(here::here("final_plots", "eugeneroads"))
paths <- here::here("final_plots", "eugeneroads", glue("{eugeneroads}.png"))

#trying to find a way to fit this in
walk2(paths, final_plots$eugeneroads, ggsave,
      width = 9.5, 
      height = 6.5,
      dpi = 500)

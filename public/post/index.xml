      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s have fun with your Strava data! This blog post is intended to provide an additional example of the ways personal data can be used. Our final product will be a ridgeline plot a la Joy Division&amp;rsquo;s Unknown Pleasures. Slap it on a t-shirt, throw it on a mug, and fool your friends! Or most likely strangers! Because your friends probably already know your musical preferences!
Them: Oh, you&amp;rsquo;re a Joy Division fan?</description>

      <description>Earlier in our blog series, you can read a post on how we used API calls to bring in data, and then another post on how to tidy and wrangle Strava data specifically. In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll jump ahead a bit and use a few parallel iteration tactics to gather some fundamental data visualizations that you can customize.
And so, let&amp;rsquo;s get started on some of the tricky stuff! In order to display weekly trends, we will need to convert the standard date format into days of the week.</description>

      <description>Strava (http://labs.strava.com) is a data rich platform to collect, store, and use physical activity data. One key challenge faced by many sporting enthusiasts is how to effectively take control of their own data to make novel and interesting visualizations or depictions of oneâ€™s hard work. In some senses, Strava makes this easy by packing your data for you with options on how you wish to view your achievements.</description>
